## Firebase Integration

`src/firebaseConfig.js` exports:

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `auth` | Firebase Authentication instance |
| `db` | Firestore database instance |
| `googleProvider` | Google OAuth provider |

`AuthProvider` wraps the entire app and exposes the current user via React Context.

> **Note:** Firebase config values in `firebaseConfig.js` are client-safe public identifiers. Secure your data with proper **Firestore Security Rules** before going to production.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, npm 9+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umanggkhhatri/Project-Academia-Industry-Interface-Platform-.git
cd Project-Academia-Industry-Interface-Platform-
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with Turbopack |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm start` | Serve production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

---

## Environment Variables

For production, move Firebase config to `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

Then update `firebaseConfig.js` to read from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
